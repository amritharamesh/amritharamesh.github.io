		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>7th Grade at Lawson Middle School</p>
		<p>I aspire to be:</p>
		<p>Someone who does something creative and design related. Not a doctor, that's for sure. Doctors are fine, but surgery and blood do not go well with me. If I do go in to Medicine, I hope it's a neurosurgeon or a Medical Lawyer. Coding and programming are actually really cool and I would love to go into the more Creative and artistic aspect of it, rather than the mathematical and strategic aspect. Also, I think I want to go into politics. I don't want to be a politician, but I know what goes behind the scenes of a campain and that seems really interesting, especially the fact that you are marketing a person. Well of course, everyone has far-fetched dreams that we all daydream that one day we will do. For me, it's a singer and it has always be a singer and will always be a singer. I love singing, and would love to take it up as a profession, but realistically, that will never happen</p>
